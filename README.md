1. hash map program only handle integer data type both key and value 
hash map program writen in main.cpp file and additional one header file required to run hashmap.h you can run main.cpp file directly 

three function exist for directly interact
(a). insertkeyAndValue: this function take three parameter first pointer to node class vector, second key(only integer) and third one value(only integer);

(b). deletekeyAndValue: delete the value from hash map two argument accept first object of hashmap and second key(only integer).

(c). searchkeyAndValue: search key exist or not first hashmap object and second key(only integer).


2. second problem Egyption fraction in Egyption.cpp (brute force implemntation) directly run using gcc compiler and follow instruction which are in terminal.

3. Collatz Problem: third problem in Collatz.cpp directly run using gcc compiler.
